Maintain CLI environments to work on different projets or clients.

Problem
-------

You have to manage several environments. For example for clients or for different projects. Each project has it's own AWS keys, Chef/Puppet/Your-own-super-cool-tool-here settings, etc. You end up with a bunch of shell scripts that set up such environments. You wish they would be organized better but you never have the time to do that.

Suggested solution
------------------
E provides lightweight framework in bash allowing some order and organization of such scripts. E also makes it easy to move the common parts of such scripts to one place, allowing better maintenance.
